# SolarSpectra

Python code to calculate solar spectra for different location in different weather conditions.
SolarSpectra is useful when you wnat to create the actual solar irradiance spectra without using the standard AM1.5G and account for the airmass change every day of the year.

We use SolarUtils functions and data from NASA POWER Database.
